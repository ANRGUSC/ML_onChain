# ECHO
This project aims to:
1. Write a solidity contract generator for a given machine learning classifier description
2. Write a Pytorch -> Solidity Interpreter (Init + Forward)
3. Find some mathematical optimization in a basic classifier architecture to preserve prediction accuracy on a smart contract
4. Find a use case for classifiers in DeFi

## Sol classifiers
current available sol classifiers includes KNN, log_regression, naive_bayes, perception, simpleMLP, and SVM

## Interpreter 

## Model deployment 

## Floating Point Computations
used ABDK64x64 int128 due to sol's lack of native floating-point computation support

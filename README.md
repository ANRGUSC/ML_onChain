## Goals
1. Write a solidity contract generator for a given machine learning classifier description
2. Write a Keras -> Solidity Interpreter
3. Find some mathematical optimization in a basic classifier architecture to preserve prediction accuracy on a smart contract
4. Find a use case for classifiers in DeFi

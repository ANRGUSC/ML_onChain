## Contracts 

## Hero
- sample testing file

## Classifier
- CNN
- log_regression
- perceptron (SVM and perceptron have essentially the same forward pass while they only differ in training (kernel trick)) 
- (knn, centroid, etc. classifiers are too simple)
- adaboost, xgboost have basic classifier architectures but perform different steps in fitting to reduce errors on bad cases/overfitting
- We can use transformers/ViTs for zero-shot text/image classification but quality models are too large for smart contracts

## libraries
- libraries used by the classifiers
